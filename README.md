## CryptoCrunch

CryptoCrunch is a cryptocurrency price tracker built in Next.js, Tailwindcss, Firebase, and Vercel hosting.
It fetches it's data from the CoinGecko API which allow for up to date cryptocurrency prices.

Firebase is used to allow user authentication and authorisation. It is also used to allow CRUD operations in the web app such as adding a cryptocurrency to your list.

I used React for this build because it's great for repeating components such as the 'SavedCoin' component. It also works great with Tailwindcss to create a stunning front-end.
